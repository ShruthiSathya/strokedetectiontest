# Results Display Improvements

## 🎯 Enhanced Results Page for Better Testing

I've updated the iOS app to prominently display the **severity level** instead of just "drift detected" or not. This will make it much easier for you to test and see the results clearly.

### ✅ **Changes Made:**

#### **1. Prominent Severity Display**
- Added a **large, highlighted severity level** at the top of the results page
- Shows **STROKE SEVERITY LEVEL** with color-coded display
- Includes the **asymmetry percentage** for reference

#### **2. Updated Clinical Data Section**
- Changed from "Drift: ✅ Yes / ❌ No" to **"Severity: NORMAL/MILD/MODERATE/SEVERE/CRITICAL"**
- Added **"Drift Level"** with emoji indicators
- Changed "Y-Diff" to **"Asymmetry"** for clarity

#### **3. Color-Coded Severity Levels**
- 🟢 **NORMAL**: Green
- 🟡 **MILD**: Yellow  
- 🟠 **MODERATE**: Orange
- 🔴 **SEVERE**: Red
- 🟣 **CRITICAL**: Purple

### 📱 **What You'll See Now:**

#### **Before (Old Display):**
```
📊 CLINICAL DATA
Drift: ✅ Yes
Pronation: ❌ No
Y-Diff: 5.2%
Quality: good_calibration_analysis
```

#### **After (New Display):**
```
STROKE SEVERITY LEVEL
⚠️ MILD

📊 CLINICAL DATA
Severity: MILD
Drift Level: ⚠️ MILD
Asymmetry: 5.2%
Quality: good_calibration_analysis
```

### 🎯 **Benefits for Testing:**

1. **Instant Recognition**: You'll immediately see the severity level in large, colored text
2. **Clear Classification**: No more guessing - you'll see NORMAL, MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, or CRITICAL
3. **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded severity levels make it easy to spot results
4. **Percentage Display**: Shows the exact asymmetry percentage for reference

### 🧪 **Testing Made Easy:**

Now when you test your app:
- **Hold arms straight** → You'll see **🟢 NORMAL** prominently displayed
- **Slight arm movement** → You'll see **🟡 MILD** 
- **More noticeable drift** → You'll see **🟠 MODERATE**
- **Significant drift** → You'll see **🔴 SEVERE**
- **Extreme drift** → You'll see **🟣 CRITICAL**

### 🚀 **Ready to Test:**

Your iOS app now has a **much clearer results display** that will make testing and validation much easier. The severity level will be the first thing you see on the results page, making it impossible to miss!

**Build and test your app - you'll love the new clear severity display!** 🎉
