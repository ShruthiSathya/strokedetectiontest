# Lambda Code Comparison: Current vs Proposed

## üìä **Comparison Analysis**

### **Current Code vs Your Proposed Code:**

| Aspect | Current Code | Your Proposed Code | Winner |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Core Logic** | ‚úÖ Identical | ‚úÖ Identical | Tie |
| **Error Handling** | ‚úÖ Detailed logging | ‚ùå Basic | **Current** |
| **Debug Information** | ‚úÖ Extensive | ‚ùå None | **Current** |
| **Division by Zero** | ‚úÖ `< 0.01` threshold | ‚ùå `== 0` check | **Current** |
| **Performance Tracking** | ‚úÖ Analysis time | ‚ùå None | **Current** |
| **Code Clarity** | ‚úÖ Well documented | ‚úÖ Clean & simple | **Tie** |

## üîç **Detailed Analysis**

### **1. Core Calculation Logic**
Both codes use **identical logic**:
```python
# Both do the same thing:
vertical_drift_pixels = abs(left_wrist_y - right_wrist_y)
avg_arm_length = (abs(left_wrist_y - left_shoulder_y) + abs(right_wrist_y - right_shoulder_y)) / 2
asymmetry_score = vertical_drift_pixels / avg_arm_length
```

### **2. Error Handling**

#### **Current Code (Better):**
```python
if avg_arm_length < 0.01:  # Use small threshold for normalized coordinates
    print(f"   ‚ö†Ô∏è Avg arm length too small: {avg_arm_length:.4f}")
    asymmetry_score = 0.0
```

#### **Your Proposed Code:**
```python
if avg_arm_length == 0:
    return {'asymmetry_score': 0.0} # Avoid division by zero
```

**Winner: Current Code** - Uses a small threshold (0.01) instead of exact zero, which is more robust for floating-point calculations.

### **3. Debug Information**

#### **Current Code (Much Better):**
```python
print(f"üîç Keypoint Analysis Debug:")
print(f"   Left wrist Y: {left_wrist_y}")
print(f"   Right wrist Y: {right_wrist_y}")
print(f"   Vertical drift: {vertical_drift_pixels:.4f}")
print(f"   Left arm length: {left_arm_length:.4f}")
print(f"   Right arm length: {right_arm_length:.4f}")
print(f"   Avg arm length: {avg_arm_length:.4f}")
print(f"   ‚úÖ Calculated asymmetry: {asymmetry_score:.4f} ({asymmetry_score*100:.1f}%)")
```

#### **Your Proposed Code:**
```python
# No debug information
```

**Winner: Current Code** - Provides essential debugging information that helps troubleshoot issues like your 22.6% asymmetry.

### **4. Performance Tracking**

#### **Current Code:**
```python
start_time = time.time()
# ... calculation ...
analysis_time = time.time() - start_time
return {
    'asymmetry_score': asymmetry_score,
    'analysis_time': analysis_time,
    'error': None
}
```

#### **Your Proposed Code:**
```python
# No performance tracking
```

**Winner: Current Code** - Tracks analysis time for performance monitoring.

### **5. Error Reporting**

#### **Current Code:**
```python
except (KeyError, TypeError) as e:
    logger.error(f"Keypoint analysis failed due to missing key: {e}")
    return {
        'asymmetry_score': 0.0,
        'analysis_time': time.time() - start_time,
        'error': f"Missing keypoints: {str(e)}"
    }
```

#### **Your Proposed Code:**
```python
except (KeyError, TypeError):
    return {'asymmetry_score': 0.0}
```

**Winner: Current Code** - Provides detailed error information and logging.

## üéØ **Recommendation**

### **Keep the Current Code** for these reasons:

1. **Better Error Handling**: Uses `< 0.01` threshold instead of `== 0`
2. **Essential Debug Information**: Helps troubleshoot issues like your 22.6% asymmetry
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitors analysis time
4. **Detailed Error Reporting**: Better logging and error messages
5. **Production Ready**: More robust for real-world use

### **Your Proposed Code is Good For:**
- **Simplicity**: Cleaner, more readable
- **Learning**: Easier to understand the core logic
- **Prototyping**: Good for initial development

## üîß **If You Want to Simplify**

If you prefer cleaner code, here's a **hybrid approach** that keeps the essential features:

```python
def analyze_drift_from_keypoints(keypoints: Dict) -> Dict:
    """
    Calculates a drift score based on keypoint coordinates.
    Returns a normalized asymmetry score between 0.0 and 1.0+.
    """
    try:
        # Extract keypoints
        left_wrist_y = keypoints['left_wrist']['y']
        right_wrist_y = keypoints['right_wrist']['y']
        left_shoulder_y = keypoints['left_shoulder']['y']
        right_shoulder_y = keypoints['right_shoulder']['y']
        
        # Calculate vertical drift
        vertical_drift_pixels = abs(left_wrist_y - right_wrist_y)
        
        # Calculate average arm length for normalization
        avg_arm_length = (abs(left_wrist_y - left_shoulder_y) + abs(right_wrist_y - right_shoulder_y)) / 2
        
        # Avoid division by zero with small threshold
        if avg_arm_length < 0.01:
            return {'asymmetry_score': 0.0}
            
        # Calculate asymmetry score
        asymmetry_score = vertical_drift_pixels / avg_arm_length
        
        # Essential debug info (simplified)
        print(f"üîç Asymmetry: {asymmetry_score:.4f} ({asymmetry_score*100:.1f}%)")
        
        return {'asymmetry_score': asymmetry_score}

    except (KeyError, TypeError) as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Keypoint analysis failed: {e}")
        return {'asymmetry_score': 0.0}
```

## üéØ **Final Verdict**

**Keep the current code** - it's more robust and provides essential debugging information that helps solve issues like your 22.6% asymmetry detection. The additional complexity is worth it for production use.

Your proposed code is good for learning and understanding the core logic, but the current code is better for real-world deployment.
