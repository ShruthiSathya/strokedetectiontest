# Keypoint Detection Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 **Debug Version Added**

I've added debug logging to help identify why keypoint detection isn't working properly. The updated code will now:

1. **Lower confidence threshold** from 0.7 to 0.3 for better detection
2. **Print confidence levels** for each keypoint
3. **Show detection success/failure** for each body part
4. **Display total keypoints** detected

## 🧪 **How to Debug:**

### **Step 1: Build and Run**
Build your iOS app and run it. Check the Xcode console for debug output.

### **Step 2: Look for Debug Messages**
You should see messages like:
```
🔍 Left wrist confidence: 0.85
✅ Left wrist detected
🔍 Right wrist confidence: 0.72
✅ Right wrist detected
📊 Total keypoints detected: 4
📊 Specific keypoints: left_wrist, right_wrist, left_shoulder, right_shoulder
📊 Confidence levels: 4 keypoints above 0.3 threshold
```

### **Step 3: Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: No Debug Messages**
**Problem**: No debug output in console
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're running on a device (not simulator)
- Check that camera permissions are granted
- Ensure the app is in the foreground

#### **Issue 2: Low Confidence Scores**
**Problem**: Confidence scores like 0.1, 0.2
**Solutions**:
- **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting on your body
- **Distance**: Move closer to the camera (2-3 feet away)
- **Pose**: Stand with arms fully extended horizontally
- **Background**: Use a plain background if possible
- **Clothing**: Wear contrasting colors (dark clothes on light background)

#### **Issue 3: Only 1-2 Keypoints Detected**
**Problem**: Getting "Poor" calibration despite person being in frame
**Solutions**:
- **Arm Position**: Extend both arms horizontally at shoulder height
- **Body Position**: Face the camera directly
- **Camera Angle**: Hold device at eye level
- **Stability**: Hold device steady

#### **Issue 4: Vision Framework Errors**
**Problem**: "Vision error" messages in console
**Solutions**:
- Restart the app
- Check device compatibility (iOS 14+ required)
- Try on a different device

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **Good Detection (Should see 6+ keypoints):**
```
🔍 Left wrist confidence: 0.85
✅ Left wrist detected
🔍 Right wrist confidence: 0.82
✅ Right wrist detected
🔍 Left shoulder confidence: 0.91
✅ Left shoulder detected
🔍 Right shoulder confidence: 0.89
✅ Right shoulder detected
🔍 Left elbow confidence: 0.76
✅ Left elbow detected
🔍 Right elbow confidence: 0.74
✅ Right elbow detected
📊 Total keypoints detected: 6
📊 Specific keypoints: left_wrist, right_wrist, left_shoulder, right_shoulder, left_elbow, right_elbow
📊 Confidence levels: 6 keypoints above 0.3 threshold
```

### **Calibration Results:**
- **6+ keypoints** → "Perfect! ✅" or "Good! ⚡"
- **4-5 keypoints** → "Acceptable ✓"
- **2-3 keypoints** → "Poor 📍"

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Build and test** the app with debug logging
2. **Check console output** for keypoint detection details
3. **Try different positions** and lighting conditions
4. **Share the debug output** if you're still having issues

## 📱 **Tips for Better Detection:**

- **Stand 2-3 feet** from the camera
- **Extend arms horizontally** at shoulder height
- **Face the camera directly**
- **Use good lighting** (natural light is best)
- **Wear contrasting colors**
- **Keep device steady**

The debug version will help us identify exactly what's happening with the keypoint detection! 🔍
